    Data Scientist for Airconomy (Frankfurt am Main, Germany).

    Data mining on various sources to forecast passenger demands over
    airline networks.

    PhD in Operations Research with Amadeus (Sophia Antipolis, France).

    Researched how to assign aircraft on an airline network in the most
    efficient way. I authored several projects, including a C++ solver,
    a Python suite of 20+ command line tools, and Hadoop data mining
    scripts. I also worked as a teaching assistant at the university,
    further improving my communication and public speaking skills.

2008 (3 months)
    Internship at Rio Tinto Alcan (Clermont Ferrand, France).

    Co-authored a C++ library for optimizing the revenue of a metal
    factory. This work was published in the corporate journal of the
    company.

2007 (3 months)
    Internship at GE Healthcare (Paris, France).

    Elaborated an UML spec for the refactoring of 20.000 lines of C++.
